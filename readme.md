two-player adversarial game
================================
At the heart of a two-player adversarial game is the Minimax Algorithm. It tells us what the current (max) playerâ€™s best move is. Additionally, the alpha-beta pruning modification makes the overall algorithm more efficient.

manual solution
---------------
See manual solution in solution.pdf

how to use minimax_a_b.py
-------------------------
Use Python 3.6.6. Run "python minimax_a_b.py test_file_name" in command line. 

Result
------
For minimax, I give the final value and action should take and all nodes should be in this part. For alpha-beta, I give the visited nodes, pruning places, final value and action. If you need to see the nodes in minimax part, you only need to take off the "#" comment in line 75 and 88.
